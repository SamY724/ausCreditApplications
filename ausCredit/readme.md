Australian Credit Application Analysis

Description
This project is an analysis of the Australian Credit Approval dataset from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict whether a given credit application will be approved or not, using various machine learning techniques and data visualisation. This was achieved using multiple different models, ranging from logistic regression to SVM

Prerequisites
Google Colaboratory (Colab) or Jupyter Notebook
Python 3.10
Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Installation
To open and run the notebook in Google Colab, click on the following link:

Open in Google Colab

Alternatively, you can download the notebook and open it in Jupyter Notebook.

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

`!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scikit-optimize`

Usage
Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Mount the drive, and upload the .dat file
Run the code cells in the order they appear in the notebook.
Adjust any user-defined parameters or settings as needed.
Observe and interpret the results, including visualisations and model performance metrics.
